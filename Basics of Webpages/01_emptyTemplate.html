<!-- Welcome to HTML! Lets jump right in. This is how comments are written in? HTML. -->

<!-- 
    !DOCTYPE tells the computer which type of file it is.
    We want to tell it that it is an html file so we put “html”.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Also notice that it's in between arrows.
These are called "tags". Everything in html is a tag. 
Even comments are tags! -->

<!-- This is the "html" tag. Everything you want the computer to read must be in here. -->
<!-- The language should be set to English but it's not really important for projects that aren't online.
It's more so for putting it online; you want to tell Google that this site is for English (language?) users.
Without this, Great Google won't know what language this site is for and won't show it in their results -->
<html lang="en">

<!-- The 'head' tag stores all the information about your website that isn't displayed on the page.
This includes things like 'charset', 'title', 'scripts' (in most cases), etc. -->
<head>
    <!-- This is how characters are stored and displayed.
    The old way was ASCII, but UTF-8 can hold a lot more charcters and has 
    all the emojis as well, so definitely use UTF-8 -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <!-- This tells the computer how the dimesions of the page should be.
    This is helpful for making a website look right on a computer, phone, smart TV, you name it.
    It makes the most sense to have it be the width of the device and to not zoom in, but
    if that's not what you want then you can look up the different options for viewport online.  -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!-- This names the tab. Google also probobly reads this to know how to display
    the name of your site in the search results. -->
    <title>Name of the tab</title>

<!-- This is the closing tab for the "head" tag.
Most tags have closing tags, but some don't.
The closing tags are used when you want to be able to store text or other tags in that tag.

Open and closing tags are all formatted the same (except for comments, they're special).
<tagname> some content </tagname>
Open tags only have the arrows and the closing tags have a slash after the first arrow.

The "head" tag has a closing tag because it needs to start all the information we just went over.
The "title" tag has a closing tag because it needs to store text.
The "meta" tag doesn't have a closing tag because it's just holding values within itself. -->

<!-- The body is where all the information about what the HTML file should display to the page. (May want to review this sentence?)
This includes text, images, links, buttons, etc.
If you want it to be on your page for a user to see, it goes into the body tag.-->
<body>

    <!-- After explaining everything above once, we won't talk about it again.
    You won't really need to understand it fully, so don't worry if it seems like a lot.

    The only thing you need to take away from that I is is (review this) that every HTML file must include everything
    you see in this file or it won't work properly.

    If you use VSCode, you can just type ! and click enter and it'll automatically
    type out all of this for you.
    
    I strongly recommend doing that as you don't need to change most of what's 
    typed out by default other than the title -->

    <!-- After this, we'll talk about what can go into the 'body'.
    There's a lot, so we'll just cover the bare basics that you would use regularly. -->

<!-- Here are the final closing tags.
It's pretty normal for a lot of websites to (missing word here) certain scripts to come after the 'body' for reasons
we'll get to later, but the closing 'html' file is the last thing the computer will read. This
will conclude the basics of setting up an html file. Now we can start working on putting content
into your 'body tag'. Good luck and have fun! -->
