<body>
    <h1>
        This is a header 1 tag (h1 tag). if you're fimilar with writting an essay, it's exactly the same.
        Header 1 is meant for titles of sections and then the sub sections are heading 2, 3, 4, ect.
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Here's Header 2 (h2 tag)
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Header 3 (h3 tag)
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Header 4 (h4 tag)
    </h4>
    <h5>
        Header 5 (h5 tag)
    </h5>
    <h6>
        and the last one, Header 6 (h6 tag). If you need to go lower than this,
        just display it as regular text. hopfully you're never in that situation.
    </h6>

    <p>
        This is the "paragraph" tag (p tag). This is made for displaying a paragraph of text. 
        Now one thing you may have noticed if you tried to open this file on your 
        browser is that the enter spaces aren't the same as they are in the file. 
        This is quite helpful because we don't know the size the screen which is going to open 
        this file. It could be on the phone, my laptop, I could even go to my old 3DS and open this site 
        and it would be expected to format everything properly on the screen. For that 
        reason, the enter spaces are ignored.
    </p>

    <pre>
If you do though want to keep the enter spaces,
you can use the "preformatted" tag (pre tag). 
should work as long as the device you're using
is wide enough to display it properly. Just 
remember to keep in mind that everything is the
exact same in this. I could even start typing 
                here and it would see that I 
                started typing with a bunch of
                tabs in front so you can't 
                indent your text in a "pre" 
                tag (unless you want tabs).
    </pre>

    <p>We also have link tags. This isn't a link tag 
    but <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp">This is! This is a link tag inside of
    a paragraph tag. All text in a link tag is a part of the link. 
    To have your link send you to a website onclick, you need to give it a URL.
    The URL is put in the 'href' inline value as you see above. For this link, 'href' is eqaul to a URL which 
    takes you to an amazing website which is incredibly usful when trying to learn almost any web language
    and a few others.</a> As you may also see. Paragraph tags can hold not only text but other tags as well
    so they're not just for text but for any text based tag. I imagine any tag that works inside the body 
    would technically work but I wouldn't recommend it. It could get really messy and wouldn't be useful</p>

    <p>next we'll talk about lists. Let's start with an ordered list</p>

    <ol>
        <li>This is an ordered list (ol tag)</li>
        <li>This will number every "list" tag inside of it</li>
        <li>The numbering is happening automatically, it is not displayed in the file</li>
        <li>you can change how the numbering to roman</li>
    </ol>

    <p>you can change the way an ordered list numbers each element by setting the inline value "type"</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "1"</li>
    </ol>

    <ol type="A">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "A"</li>
    </ol>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "a"</li>
    </ol>

    <ol type="I">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "I"</li>
    </ol>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "i"</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now let's talk about an unordered list</p>

    <ul>
        <li>This is an unordered list (ul tag)</li>
        <li>This does not display the number in each list</li>
        <li>
            Even though it's called an unoreder list, this doesn't
            mean that it will display in a random order.
        </li>
        <li>
            The only difference between ol and ul is that
            ol is numbered and ul has dots.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        unodered lists also have different "type" but we can't do those ones yet.
        We need to use styles to do that so we'll come back to that.
    </p>

    <p>The final type of list is a detailed list. A detailed list works a little differently then the rest.
        in a detailed list, you give each "list" tag a title. This may be useful if instead of each list having
        1,2,3,4, ect in front, maybe you want Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, ect.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Title</dt>
        <dd>This is how to make a detailed list</dd>

        <dt>Step 1 (setup)</dt>
        <dd>(write dl and put arrows around it)</dd>
        <dd>(write /dl two lines down and put arrows around it)</dd>

        <dt>Step 2 (put a title in your detailed list)</dt>
        <dd>(write dt and put arrows around in)</dd>
        <dd>(write your title)</dd>
        <dd>(write /dt and put arrows around it</dd>

        <dt>Step 3 (put in a description for your title)</dt>
        <dd>(go a line down and write dd with arrows around it)</dd>
        <dd>(write your description)</dd>
        <dd>(write /dd with arrows around it)</dd>
        <dd>
            (repeat step 3 as many times as you want until you have
            as many descriptions as you need)
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Step 4 (repeat)</dt>
        <dd>repeat step 2</dd>
        <dd>repeat step 3</dd>
        <dd>
            repeat step 4 until you have as many
            entries as you need
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        This concludes the basics for text tags. Now you may have noticed something pretty much
        as soon as you opened this HTML page. Everything is ugly. This is beacuse we haven't
        added any styles or style sheets yet. We won't get into that for a bit but just keep it
        in mind when you're wondering why everything being displayed is very gross and hard to read.
        It is a very easy fix, we just aren't there yet. Next we'll talk about some other basic tags
        which aren't made for storing text. Good luck and have fun!
    </p>
