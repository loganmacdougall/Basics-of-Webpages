<body>
    <h1>
        This is a header 1 tag (h1 tag). If you're familiar with writing an essay, it's exactly the same.
        Header 1 is meant for titles of sections and then the sub sections following have heading 2, 3, 4, etc.
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Here's Header 2 (h2 tag)
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Header 3 (h3 tag)
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Header 4 (h4 tag)
    </h4>
    <h5>
        Header 5 (h5 tag)
    </h5>
    <h6>
        and the last one, Header 6 (h6 tag). If you need to go lower than this,
        just display it as regular text. Hopefully you're never in that situation.
    </h6>

    <p>
        This is the "paragraph" tag (p tag). This is made for displaying a paragraph of text. 
        Now, one thing you may have noticed if you tried opening this file on your 
        browser is that the enter spaces aren't the same as they are in the file. 
        This is quite helpful because we don't know the size of the screen that will be opening 
        this file. This site could be opened on a phone, a laptop, or even an old 3DS and the site 
        would be expected to format everything properly on the screen. For that 
        reason, the enter spaces are ignored and put in when necessary.
    </p>

    <pre>
If you do though, want to keep the enter spaces,
you can use the "preformatted" tag (pre tag). 
This should work as long as the device you're using
is wide enough to display it properly. Just 
remember to keep in mind that everything is the
exact same in this. I could even start typing 
                here and it would see that I 
                started typing with a bunch of
                tabs in front so you can't 
                indent your text in a "pre" 
                tag (unless you want tabs).
    </pre>

    <p>We also have link tags. This isn't a link tag, 
    but <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp">This is! This is a link tag inside of
    a paragraph tag. All text in a link tag is a part of the link. 
    To have your link send you to a website onclick, you need to give it a URL.
    The URL is put in the 'href' inline value as you see above. For this link, 'href' is equal to a URL, which 
    takes you to an amazing website which is incredibly useful when trying to learn almost any web language
    and a few others.</a> As you may also see, paragraph tags can hold more than just text, but other tags as well;
    they can be used for any text based tag. I imagine any tag that works inside the body 
    would technically work, but I wouldn't recommend it. It could get really messy and wouldn't be useful.</p>

    <p>Next, we'll talk about lists. Let's start with an ordered list.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>This is an ordered list (ol tag)</li>
        <li>This will number every "list" tag inside of it</li>
        <li>The numbering is happening automatically, it is not displayed in the file</li>
        <li>You can also change how the the list will automatically number each "list" tag</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can change the way an ordered list numbers each element by setting the inline value of "type"</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "1"</li>
    </ol>

    <ol type="A">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "A"</li>
    </ol>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "a"</li>
    </ol>

    <ol type="I">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "I"</li>
    </ol>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>This</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>type = "i"</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now let's talk about an unordered list</p>

    <ul>
        <li>This is an unordered list (ul tag)</li>
        <li>This does not display the number in each list</li>
        <li>
            Even though it's called an unordered list, this doesn't
            mean that it will display in a random order.
        </li>
        <li>
            The only difference between ol and ul is that
            ol is numbered and ul has dots.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Unordered lists also have different "type", but we can't do those ones yet.
        We need to use styles to do that, so we'll come back to that later.
    </p>

    <p>The final type of list is a detailed list. A detailed list works a little differently than the rest.
        In a detailed list, you give each "list" tag a title. This may be useful instead of each list having
        1, 2, 3, 4, etc. in front. This would allow you do do things like: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Title</dt>
        <dd>This is how to make a detailed list</dd>

        <dt>Step 1 (setup)</dt>
        <dd>(write dl and put arrows around it)</dd>
        <dd>(write /dl two lines down and put arrows around it)</dd>

        <dt>Step 2 (put a title in your detailed list)</dt>
        <dd>(write dt and put arrows around in)</dd>
        <dd>(write your title)</dd>
        <dd>(write /dt and put arrows around it</dd>

        <dt>Step 3 (put in a description for your title)</dt>
        <dd>(go a line down and write dd with arrows around it)</dd>
        <dd>(write your description)</dd>
        <dd>(write /dd with arrows around it)</dd>
        <dd>
            (repeat step 3 as many times as you want until you have
            as many descriptions as you need)
        </dd>
        
        <dt>Step 4 (repeat)</dt>
        <dd>repeat step 2</dd>
        <dd>repeat step 3</dd>
        <dd>
            repeat step 4 until you have as many
            entries as you need
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
        This concludes the basics for text tags. Now, you may have noticed something pretty much
        as soon as you opened this HTML page. Everything is ugly. This is because we haven't
        added any styles or style sheets yet. We won't get into that for a bit, but just keep it
        in mind when you're wondering why everything being displayed is very gross and hard to read.
        It is a very easy fix, we just aren't there yet. Next, we'll talk about some other basic tags
        which aren't made for storing text. Good luck and have fun!
