    <h1>An Introduction to Styles</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        If you have seen all the files up until this point, you're probobly wanting
        to know the difference in styles between a div and a span.
        Before We go over that, let's start with what a style is.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A style is a but of CSS code which your HTML file will run to chagnge how it looks.
        there are three ways you can add CSS code to your HTML file
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You can create a CSS file and use the link tag in the head tag to link
            your CSS file to this HTML page.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can create a style tag in the head tag which can contain all
            of your CSS code.
        </li>
        <li>You can add styles as inline values to individual tags.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        The last way is the worst way to add styles as you have to add styles to each
        tag individually unlike the first and second method where you can add styles to a bunch
        of like tags all at once (ex: adding a style to every p tag).
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, because we are trying to show each style indivually, it would be pretty
        annoying to tell you to switch between files or to get you to scroll up and down just to see what I've added
        to each tag so for this case, I will be adding each style on each tag individually but in a normal
        project, I recommend against it.
    </p>

        Let's start by walking you through how to add a style to a tag with 
        the most basic and useful style (in my opinion). The background color.
        (Also, to anybody who thinks I just spelt color wrong, if you spell color
        as "colour" when using CSS, it won't work.
        I'm from Canada where the correct spelling woudld be "colour" but make
        sure that you do spell it the way CSS wants or it'll do nothing).
