    <h1>An Introduction to Styles</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        If you have seen all the files up until this point, you're probobly wanting
        to know the difference in styles between a div and a span.
        Before We go over that, let's start with what a style is.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A style is a but of CSS code which your HTML file will run to change how it looks.
        there are three ways you can add CSS code to your HTML file
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You can create a CSS file and use the link tag in the head tag to link
            your CSS file to this HTML page.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can create a style tag in the head tag which can contain all
            of your CSS code.
        </li>
        <li>You can add styles as inline values to individual tags.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        The last way is the worst way to add styles as you have to add styles to each
        tag individually unlike the first and second method where you can add styles to a bunch
        of like tags all at once (ex: adding a style to every p tag).
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, because we are trying to show each style indivually, it would be pretty
        annoying to tell you to switch between files or to get you to scroll up and down just to see what I've added
        to each tag so for this case, I will be adding each style on each tag individually but in a normal
        project, I recommend against it.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Let's start by walking you through how to add a style to a tag with 
        the most basic and useful style (in my opinion). The background color.
        (Also, to anybody who thinks I just spelt color wrong, if you spell color
        as "colour" when using CSS, it won't work.
        I'm from Canada where the correct spelling woudld be "colour" but make
        sure that you do spell it the way CSS wants or it'll do nothing).
    </p>

    <p>In the tag you'd like add an inline style to, we'll start by creating the "style" value.</p>
    <p>style</p>
    <p>Then, we need to set it equal to a string of CSS code. Let's start by setting equal to an empty string.</p>
    <p>style = ""</p>
    <p>
        Now we can create some CSS code to put in the string. We can now set the background color. To change
        the background color, just type "background-color: " and then the color you want, followed with a semicolon (;).
        For example, if you wanted the background color to be cyan, we can type within the style string "background-color: cyan;".
    </p>
    <p>style = "background-color: cyan;"</p>
    <p style = "background-color: cyan;">If we add this to our paragraph tag here, you'll see that the background of the paragraph tag is now cyan.</p>
    <br>
    <p>CSS has a suprising amount of colors which you can write by name.</p>
    <p style = "background-color: red;">Red</p>
    <p style = "background-color: yellow;">Yellow</p>
    <p style = "background-color: green;">Green</p>
    <p style = "background-color: blue;">Blue</p>
    <p style = "background-color: violet;">Violet</p>
    <p style = "background-color: darkcyan;">Dark Cyan</p>
    <p style = "background-color: fuchsia;">Fuchsia</p>
    <p style = "background-color: azure;">Azure</p>
    <p style = "background-color: cornflowerblue;">Corn Flower Blue</p>
    <p style = "background-color: navajowhite;">Navajo White</p>
    <p>
        If you want a color that has a name, chances are, they probobly have. If you'd like to see everything they have,
        I'd suggest checking out <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/web/css/css-color.html"> this site here</a>.
        They show you several of the different colors which can be accessed by name in CSS. I won't say that it's
        all of them just because I don't want to manually check if they're all there but I did check if they had
        Navajo White and they did so it's likely all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, if you went to that site before reading this, you may have noticed that they mentioned two other ways of
        defining the background-color. Well, there's actually a total of eight ways (as of now) to define the background-color as a solid color.
        I won't go into great detail about each one but I'll provide a link for each one which might be confusing.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Name    </dt>
            <dd>ex: Red, Bule, Purple</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">Hex color</a></dt>
            <dd>ex: ff0000, 0000ff, ff00ff</dd>
        <dt>Short Hex color</dt>
            <dd>ex: f00, 00f, f0f</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp">rgb color</a></dt>
            <dd>ex: rgb(255,0,0), rgb(0,0,255), rgb(255,0,255)</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_rgba.asp">rgba color</a></dt>
            <dd>just like rgb but you can define opacity. ex: rgba(255,0,0,1), rgba(0,0,255,1), rgba(255,0,255,1)</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp">hsl color</a></dt>
            <dd>ex: hsl(0,100%,50%), hsl(240,100%,50%), hsl(300,100%,50%)</dd>
        <dt>hlsa color</dt>
            <dd>just like hls but you can define opacity. ex: hsla(0,100%,50%,1), hsla(240,100%,50%,1), hsla(300,100%,50%,1)</dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_cmyk.asp">CMYK color</a></dt>
            <dd>ex: cmyk(0%, 100%, 100%, 0%), cmyk(100%, 100%, 0%, 0%), cmyk(0%, 100%, 0%, 0%)</dd>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The only ones I would make sure to understand are rgb color and hex color. Those ones are used
        quite often so a bit of knowledge on how they work would be ideal.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Now we're going to go into the "display" style</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>
        The display style is a little tricky to understand so we'll just start off with the basic two display types.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>block (written as display: block)</li>
        <li>inline (written as display: inline)</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p>
        display block means that it takes the tag will be as wide as possible. This is the default for most tags
        which is why when you open the file, everything is on a different line. Because all the tags have a width
        of 100% of the screen, nothing else can be on the same line. This is also the reason why when we set the
        background color of the paragraph tags, the color will continue till it hits the edge of the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        display inline mean that it takes up as little space as possible. all characters for example would be considered
        inline because in order to have text to the right and to the left of each character, it needs
        to take up the exact amount of space needed for the chaaracter and nothing more. If characters instead had a
        display type of block, each character would be on a seprate line which is definitely not ideal.
    </p>

    <p>
        here are the two different display types for the paragraph tag.
        I'll add a background color so that it's easier the size of each tag on the screen.
    </p>

    <p style="display: block;background-color: darkturquoise;">Display Block (Default)</p>
    <p style="display: inline;background-color: darkturquoise;">Display Inline</p>

    <p>
        As you can see, it makes a pretty notable difference what the display is. 
        It the background color doesn't go to the end of the screen when we use Display Inline. There are quite a
        other display types but those ones can are harder to understand so we'll skip over them for now.
        I'll provide a link to a youtube video which does a really good job of explaing all the ones we
        just went over a bit more as well as some other ones which I wasn't planning on going over
        like display flex and display grid as they are very involved.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        we can now finally talk about the difference between a div tag and a span tag.
        It's quite simple actually.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>div tag has a display of block and is meant for grouping block elements</li>
        <li>span tag has a displau of inline and is meant for grouping inline elements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This explains why div tags are meant for grouping sevral tags and span tags are meant for
        grouping chunks of text. Because most tags are block elements by default and all text is act
        like inline elements. I'll show you how we can now use this to help us control the background
        color of different tags and text.
    </p>

    <div style="background-color: cadetblue;">
        <p>I've put all of these paragraph tags in a div.</p>
        <p>Paragraph tags are block elements by default so this works well.</p>
        <p>
            You can see that it turns the background color of all these
            paragraph tags to cadet blue.
        </p>
        <p>This is because the div has a style on it which changes to background color of everything inside.</p>
        <p>
            If I wanted to have <span style="background-color: khaki;">this part of the text be a different color from the rest,</span>
            I just put that part of the text in a span tag and style the span.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        This concludes our introduction of CSS. Next, we'll get into a bunch of different styles which
        are commonly used. Good luck and have fun.
