    <h1>Basic Body Tags</h1>
    <p>
        Now that you know the basics of text based tags, 
        we're going to move on to some other tags that aren't closely related to text.
        In this file, we'll go over...
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> horizontal line tag (hr tag)</li>
        <li> break tag (br tag) </li>
        <li> image tag (img tag)</li>
        <li> division tag (div tag) </li>
        <li> span tag (span tag)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        First, let's take a look at the horizontal line tag.
        The horizontal line tag makes a line across the page to separate different elements of the page.
        It also has a margin of area that it takes up, both above and below it (8px both ways) so that
        it actually looks like it's separating the two sections. Otherwise, the two sections would
        just have a line in between and be really close together. This is not what you want.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>It has no closing tag because you can't put anything in a line. It is a line after all.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Next is the break tag. The break tag is exactly like the horizontal line tag except
        without the line, so it just takes up a margin of area (18px in height)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Now let's introduce you to the first bit of colour. Images.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>An image is pretty easy to use</p>
    <img src="https://bit.ly/2vIsIzu" title="This appears if you hover your mouse over the image" alt="An image of the HTML 5 logo" width="200px" height="200px">
    
    <br>

    <p>
        An image tag as you may suspect, can display an image.
        There are a number of inline values which you can set onto your image tag.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>src</dt>
        <dd>This is where you put the URL of your image.</dd>
        <dd>You can use the address of an image online or the file path of an image on your computer.</dd>
        <dd>The image tag can display most image types including gifs.</dd>
        <dt>title</dt>
        <dd>This one is a common inline value which can be used on almost any tag.</dd>
        <dd title="you can see that text appears if I set the title tag on any textbased tag">
            This is the text that will appear next to your mouse when you put your 
            mouse over top of the image.
        </dd>
        <dd title="you can see that text appears if I set the title tag on any textbased tag">
            If you use the title inline value on a text based tag, it'll display
            the text you set it to display when your mouse hovers over the text.
        </dd>
        <dd title="you can see that text appears if I set the title tag on any textbased tag">
            This means that if you're on a phone, you can't see the values of a title.
        </dd>
        <dt>alt</dt>
        <dd>This is the text which appears instead of the image if the image has an error trying to load in.</dd>
        <dd>
            If you have downloaded this file, you can turn off your internet and you'll still be able to load this file.
            You'll notice that the image can now no longer load, but is replaced with the text that
            I set the inline value "alt" to (in this case, it would display "An image of the HTML 5 logo").
        </dd>
        <dd>
            It's important you do this for all your images so that if anything happens to them, people
            will at least know what the image was supposed to show you.
        </dd>
        <dt>width and height</dt>
        <dd>The width and height define the dimensions of how you'd like the image to be displayed</dd>
        <dd>This is not the actual dimensions of the image.</dd>
        <dd>
            The actual image size of the HTML5 image is 1200px by 1200px. This was way to big and
            took up the entire screen so I had set the image size to have a width of 200px and a 
            height of 200px. This is a much better height as it will not cover the entire screen.
        </dd>
        <dt>ect</dt>
        <dd>Most tags have quite a few inline values that may help you in certain situations.</dd>
        <dd>
            Image tags have a few extra ones which we won't be going over as they are not needed
            nor have I ever used them.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            If you're interested in the other inline values, 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">you can go to this site</a>
            and it'll tell you everything you could want to know about the image tag.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <br>

    <p>Now let's move on to divs and spans</p>

    <hr>

    <p>
        A div tag and span tag are ways to group elements together. Like how you
        can put link tags (a tag) inside text based tags, these tags do that, but don't alter
        the text or tags in any way by default.
    </p>

    <div>
        <p>Here I have one paragraph tag inside a div</p>
        <p>Here is yet another paragrah tag in a div element</p>
        <p>div elements are meant to group large chunks of code together</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here is a paragraph tag which has <span>these words here</span> within a span tag.</p>
    <p>A span tag is mainly used to group certain chunks of text within text based tags.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>
    Now you may be wondering, "Ok, div is meant for holding large sections of code and a
    span is meant to group certain chucks of text in a text based tag. Why? What's the difference
    between div and span? Why do we even want to group anything together? It doesn't do anything!".
    </p>
    <p>
    Well, both of the questions have the same answer. Styles. The div and span have a single difference
    in their styles which makes divs used for large portions of code and spans for chucks of text. The
    next file is all on CSS and a few basic styles we can apply to tags to make them look
    different (usually to make them look a lot nicer). We'll also go over the difference between
    a div and span and it'll hopefully make more sense why they're used differently. That concludes the basics
    of HTML. Good luck and have fun.
